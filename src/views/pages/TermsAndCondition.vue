In many cities, Hosts may have to register, get a permit or obtain a license before providing certain Host Services (such as preparing food, serving alcohol for sale, guiding tours or operating a vehicle). Host are alone responsible for identifying and obtaining any required licenses, permits, or registrations for any Host Services they offer. Certain types of Host Services may be prohibited altogether. Penalties may include fines or other enforcement. We provide some information in our Help Center to help you identify some of the obligations that apply to you. If you have questions about how local laws apply to your Listing(s) and Host Service(s) on TravCP, you should always seek guidance.</h5>

            <h2 class="title">1. Scope of TravCP Services</h2>
<h5 class="description">1.1 The TravCP Platform is an online travel marketplace that enables registered users (“Members”) and certain third parties who offer services (Members and third parties who offer services “Hosts” and the services they offer “Host Services”) to publish such Host Services on the TravCP Platform (“Listings”) and to communicate and transact directly with Members that are seeking to book such Host Services (Members using Host Services are “Tourists”). Host Services may include the offering of Security services (“Security”), access to restaurants services (“Restaurants”) single or multi-day activities in various categories (“Experiences”), access to unique events and locations (“Events”), and a variety of other travel and non-travel related services.</h5>
<h5 class="description">1.2 As the provider of the TravCP Platform, TravCP does not own, create, sell, resell, provide, control, manage, offer, deliver, or supply any Listings or Host Services, nor is TravCP an organizer or retailer of travel packages under Directive (EU) 2015/2302. Hosts and service providers  alone are responsible for their Listings and Host Services. When Tourists make a booking, they are entering into a contract directly with the host/service provider and vice versa. TravCP is not and does not become a party to or other participant in any contractual relationship between members or between members and host, nor is TravCP a real estate broker or insurer. TravCP is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any member or host, except as specified in the Payments Terms.</h5>
<h5 class="description">1.3 If you choose to use the TravCP Platform as a Host (as defined below), your relationship with TravCP is limited to being an independent, third-party contractor, and not an employee, agent, joint venturer or partner of TravCP for any reason, and you act exclusively on your own behalf and for your own benefit, and not on behalf, or for the benefit, of TravCP. TravCP does not, and shall not be deemed to, direct or control you generally or in your performance under these Terms specifically, including in connection with your provision of the Host Services. You acknowledge and agree that you have complete discretion whether to list Host Services or otherwise engage in other business or employment activities.</h5>
<h5 class="description">1.4 TravCP has no control over and does not guarantee (i) the existence, quality, safety, suitability, or legality of any Listings or Host Services, (ii) the truth or accuracy of any Listing descriptions, Ratings, Reviews, or other Member Content (as defined below), or (iii) the performance or conduct of any Member or third party. TravCP does not endorse any Member, Listing or Host Services. Any references to a Member being "verified" (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification or identification process and nothing else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by TravCP about any Member, including of the Member's identity or background or whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. You should always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to participate in an Experience or Event or use other Host Services, accept a booking request from a Tourist, or communicate and interact with other Members, whether online or in person. Verified Images (as defined below) are intended only to indicate a photographic representation of a Listing at the time the photograph was taken, and are therefore not an endorsement by TravCP of any Host or Listing.</h5>
<h5 class="description">1.5 To promote the TravCP Platform and to increase the exposure of Listings to potential Tourists, Listings and other Member Content may be displayed on other websites, in applications, within emails, and in online and offline advertisements. To assist Members who speak different languages, Listings and other Member Content may be translated, in whole or in part, into other languages. TravCP cannot guarantee the accuracy or quality of such translations and Members are responsible for reviewing and verifying the accuracy of such translations. The TravCP Platform may contain translations powered by Google. Google disclaims all warranties related to the translations, express or implied, including any warranties of accuracy, reliability, and any implied warranties for merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.</h5>
<h5 class="description">1.6 The TravCP Platform may contain links to third-party websites or resources (“Third-Party Services”). Such Third-Party Services may be subject to different terms and conditions and privacy practices. TravCP is not responsible or liable for the availability or accuracy of such Third-Party Services, or the content, products, or services available from such Third-Party Services. Links to such Third-Party Services are not an endorsement by TravCP of such Third-Party Services.</h5>
<h5 class="description">1.7 Due to the nature of the Internet, TravCP cannot guarantee the continuous and uninterrupted availability and accessibility of the TravCP Platform. TravCP may restrict the availability of the TravCP Platform or certain areas or features thereof, if this is necessary in view of capacity limits, the security or integrity of our servers, or to carry out maintenance measures that ensure the proper or improved functioning of the TravCP Platform. TravCP may improve, enhance and modify the TravCP Platform and introduce new TravCP Services from time to time.</h5>

<h5 class="description">2.3 User verification on the Internet is difficult and we do not assume any responsibility for the confirmation of any Member’s identity.

<h5 class="description">2.4 TravCP may make access to and use of the TravCP Platform, or certain areas or features of the TravCP Platform, subject to certain conditions or requirements, such as completing a verification process, meeting specific quality or eligibility criteria, meeting Ratings or Reviews thresholds, or a Member’s booking and cancellation history.</h5>
<h5 class="description">2.5 The access to or use of certain areas and features of the TravCP Platform may be subject to separate policies, standards or guidelines, or may require that you accept additional terms and conditions, before you can access the relevant areas or features of the TravCP Platform. If there is a conflict between these Terms and terms and conditions applicable to a specific area or feature of the TravCP Platform, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect to your access to or use of that area or feature, unless specified otherwise in the latter terms and conditions.</h5>
<h5 class="description">2.6 If you access or download the Application from the Apple App Store, you agree to Apple’s Licensed Application End User License Agreement. Some areas of the TravCP Platform implement Google Maps/Earth mapping services, including Google Maps API(s).

If we make changes to these Terms, we will post the revised Terms on the TravCP Platform and update the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms. We will also provide you with notice of the modifications by email at least thirty (30) days before the date they become effective. If you disagree with the revised Terms, you may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect. We will inform you about your right to terminate the Agreement in the notification email. If you do not terminate your Agreement before the date the revised Terms become effective, your continued access to or use of the TravCP Platform will constitute acceptance of the revised Terms.</h5>
<h2 class="title">4. Account Registration</h2>

<h5 class="description">4.1 You must register an account ("TravCP Account") to access and use certain features of the TravCP Platform, such as publishing or booking a Listing.

<h5 class="description">4.5 You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your TravCP Account credentials and may not disclose your credentials to any third party. You must immediately notify TravCP if you know or have any reason to suspect that your credentials have been lost, stolen, misappropriated, or otherwise compromised or in case of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your TravCP Account. You are liable for any and all activities conducted through your TravCP Account, unless such activities are not authorized by you and you are not otherwise negligent (such as failing to report the unauthorized use or loss of your credentials).</h5>
<h5 class="description">4.6 TravCP may enable features that allow you to authorize other Members or certain third parties to take certain actions that affect your TravCP Account. For example, we may enable Members to link their TravCP Accounts to businesses and take actions for those businesses, we may enable eligible Members or certain third parties to book Listings on behalf of other Members, (as defined below) to help manage their Listings. These features do not require that you share your credentials with any other person. No third party is authorized by TravCP to ask for your credentials, and you shall not request the credentials of another Member.</h5>

<h5 class="description">9.5 In certain circumstances, TravCP may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary to cancel a pending or confirmed booking and initiate corresponding refunds and payouts. This may be for reasons set forth in TravCP's Extenuating Circumstances Policy or (i) where TravCP believes in good faith, while taking the legitimate interests of both parties into account, this is necessary to avoid significant harm to TravCP, other Members, third parties or property, or (ii) for any of the reasons set out in these Terms.</h5>
<h5 class="description">9.6 If a Tourist who books an Experience, Event, Restaurant or other Host Service suffers a Travel Issue as defined in the Experiences Tourist Refund Policy, TravCP may determine, in its sole discretion, to refund the Tourist part or all of the Total Fees in accordance with the Experiences Tourist Refund Policy.</h5>
<h5 class="description">9.7 If a Tourist or TravCP cancels a confirmed booking, and the Tourist receives a refund in accordance with the Tourist Refund Policy, Experiences Tourist Refund Policy, Extenuating Circumstances Policy, or the applicable cancellation policy set by the Host and mentioned in the Listing, after the Host has already been paid, TravCP Payments will be entitled to recover the amount of any such refund from the Host, including by subtracting such refund amount out from any future Payouts due to the Host.</h5>
<h5 class="description">9.8 Except as otherwise set out in these Terms, Members may use the Resolution Center to send or request money for refunds, additional Host Services or Damage Claims related to bookings. You agree to pay all amounts sent through the Resolution Center in connection with your TravCP Account, and TravCP Payments will handle all such payments.</h5>
<h5 class="description">10. Ratings and Reviews</h5>
<h5 class="description">10.1 Within a certain timeframe after completing a booking, Tourists and Hosts can leave a public review (“Review”) and submit a star rating (“Rating”) about each other. Ratings or Reviews reflect the opinions of individual Members and do not reflect the opinion of TravCP. Ratings and Reviews are not verified by TravCP for accuracy and may be incorrect or misleading.</h5>
<h5 class="description">10.2 Ratings and Reviews by Tourists and Hosts must be accurate and may not contain any offensive or defamatory language. Ratings and Reviews are subject to Section 5 and must comply with TravCP’s Content Policy and Extortion Policy.</h5>
<h5 class="description">10.3 Members are prohibited from manipulating the Ratings and Reviews system in any manner, such as instructing a third party to write a positive or negative Review about another Member.</h5>
<h5 class="description">10.4 Ratings and Reviews are part of a Member’s public profile and may also be surfaced elsewhere on the TravCP Platform (such as the Listing page) together with other relevant information such as number of bookings, number of cancellations, average response time and other information.</h5>

<h2 class="title">11. Rounding off</h2>
<h5 class="description">TravCP generally supports payment amounts that are payable from or to Tourists or Hosts to the smallest unit supported by a given currency (i.e., U.S. cents, Naira, Euro cents or other supported currencies). Where TravCP’s third-party payment services provider does not support payments in the smaller unit supported by a given currency, TravCP may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down the displayed amounts that are payable from or to Tourists or Hosts to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (i.e. to the nearest dollar, Euro or other supported currency); for example, TravCP may round up an amount of $101.50 to $102.00, and round down an amount of $101.49 to $101.00.</h5>
<h2 class="title">12. Taxes</h2>

<h2 class="title">13. Prohibited Activities.</h2>
<h5 class="description">13.1 As a Host you are solely responsible for determining your obligations to report, collect, remit or include in your Listing Fees any applicable VAT or other indirect sales taxes, tourist or other visitor taxes or income taxes ("Taxes").</h5>
<h5 class="description">13.2 Tax regulations may require us to collect appropriate Tax information from Hosts, or to withhold Taxes from payouts to Hosts, or both. If a Host fails to provide us with the required documentation under applicable law (e.g., a tax number) that we determine to be sufficient to alleviate our obligation (if any) to withhold Taxes from payouts to you, we reserve the right to withhold payouts up to the tax-relevant amount as required by law, until resolution.</h5>
<h5 class="description">13.3 The laws in jurisdictions may vary, but these Taxes may be required to be collected and remitted as a percentage of the Listing Fees set by Hosts, a set amount per day, or other variations, and are sometimes called "lodging taxes," "city taxes, “or "tourist taxes".</h5>
<h5 class="description">.2 You acknowledge that TravCP has no obligation to monitor the access to or use of the TravCP Platform by any Member or to review, disable access to, or edit any Member Content, but has the right to do so to (i) operate, secure and improve the TravCP Platform (including without limitation for fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation and customer support purposes); (ii) ensure Members’ compliance with these Terms; (iii) comply with applicable law or the order or requirement of a court, law enforcement or other administrative agency or governmental body; (iv) respond to Member Content that it determines is harmful or objectionable; or (v) as otherwise set forth in these Terms. Members agree to cooperate with and assist TravCP in good faith, and to provide TravCP with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by TravCP with respect to any investigation undertaken by TravCP or a representative of TravCP regarding the use or abuse of the TravCP Platform.</h5>
<h5 class="description">.3 If you feel that any Member you interact with, whether online or in person, is acting or has acted inappropriately, including but not limited to anyone who (i) engages in offensive, violent or sexually inappropriate behavior, (ii) you suspect of stealing from you, or (iii) engages in any other disturbing conduct, you should first and immediately report such a person to TravCP by contacting us and then to the Police and provide us with your police station report number (if available). You agree that any report you make will not obligate us to take any action (beyond that required by law, if any).</h5>

<h2 class="title">14. Term and Termination, Suspension and other Measures</h2>

<h5 class="description">14.1 This Agreement shall be effective for a 30-day term, at the end of which it will automatically and continuously renew for subsequent 30-day terms until such time when you or TravCP terminate the Agreement in accordance with this provision.</h5>
<h5 class="description">14.2 You may terminate this Agreement at any time by sending us an email. If you cancel your TravCP Account as a Host, any confirmed booking(s) will be automatically cancelled and your Tourists will receive a full refund. If you cancel your TravCP Account as a Tourist, any confirmed booking(s) will be automatically cancelled and any refund will depend upon the terms of the Listing’s cancellation policy.</h5>
<h5 class="description">14.3 Without limiting our rights specified below, TravCP may terminate this Agreement for convenience at any time by giving you thirty (30) days' notice via email to your registered email address.</h5>
<h5 class="description">14.4 TravCP may immediately, without notice, terminate this Agreement and/or stop providing access to the TravCP Platform if (i) you have materially breached your obligations under these Terms, the Payments Terms, our Policies or Standards, (ii) you have violated applicable laws, regulations or third party rights, or (iii) TravCP believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary to protect the personal safety or property of TravCP, its Members, or third parties (for example in the case of fraudulent behavior of a Member).</h5>
<h5 class="description">14.5 In addition, TravCP may take any of the following measures (i) to comply with applicable law, or the order or request of a court, law enforcement or other administrative agency or governmental body, or if (ii) you have breached these Terms, the Payments Terms, our Policies or Standards, applicable laws, regulations, or third party rights, (iii) you have provided inaccurate, fraudulent, outdated or incomplete information during the TravCP Account registration, Listing process or thereafter, (iv) you and/or your Listings or Host Services at any time fail to meet any applicable quality or eligibility criteria, (v) you have repeatedly received poor Ratings or Reviews or TravCP otherwise becomes aware of or has received complaints about your conduct, (vi) you have repeatedly cancelled confirmed bookings or failed to respond to booking requests without a valid reason, or (vii) TravCP believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary to protect the personal safety or property of TravCP, its Members, or third parties, or to prevent fraud or other illegal activity:

limit your access to or use of the TravCP Platform;
temporarily or permanently revoke any special status associated with your TravCP Account;

In case of non-material breaches and where appropriate, you will be given notice of any intended measure by TravCP and an opportunity to resolve the issue to TravCP's reasonable satisfaction.</h5>
<h5 class="description">14.6 If we take any of the measures described above (i) we may refund your Tourists in full for any and all confirmed bookings that have been cancelled, irrespective of preexisting cancellation policies, and (ii) you will not be entitled to any compensation for pending or confirmed bookings that were cancelled.</h5>
<h5 class="description">14.7 When this Agreement has been terminated, you are not entitled to a restoration of your TravCP Account or any of your Member Content. If your access to or use of the TravCP Platform has been limited or your TravCP Account has been suspended or this Agreement has been terminated by us, you may not register a new TravCP Account or access and use the TravCP Platform through an TravCP Account of another Member.</h5>
<h5 class="description">14.8 Sections 5 and 16 to 22 of these Terms shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.</h5>

<h2 class="title">15. Disclaimers</h2>
<h5 class="description">If you choose to use the TravCP Platform or Collective Content, you do so voluntarily and at your sole risk. The TravCP Platform and Collective Content is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, either express or implied.
You agree that you have had whatever opportunity you deem necessary to investigate the TravCP Services, laws, rules, or regulations that may be applicable to your Listings and/or Host Services you are receiving and that you are not relying upon any statement of law or fact made by TravCP relating to a Listing.
If we choose to conduct identity verification or background checks on any Member, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim warranties of any kind, either express or implied, that such checks will identify prior misconduct by a Member or guarantee that a Member will not engage in misconduct in the future.
You agree that some Experiences, Events, other Host Services, or the Group Payment Service may carry inherent risk, and by participating in such services, you choose to assume those risks voluntarily. For example, some Host Services may carry risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death, and you freely and willfully assume those risks by choosing to participate in those Host Services. You assume full responsibility for the choices you make before, during and after your participation in a Host Service or the Group Payment Service. If you are bringing a minor as an additional Tourist, you are solely responsible for the supervision of that minor throughout the duration of your Host Service and to the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to release and hold harmless TravCP from all liabilities and claims that arise in any way from any injury, death, loss or harm that occurs to that minor during the Host Service or in any way related to your Host Service.
The foregoing disclaimers apply to the maximum extent permitted by law. You may have other statutory rights. However, the duration of statutorily required warranties, if any, shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</h5>
<h2 class="title">16. Liability</h2>
<h5 class="description">You acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the TravCP Platform and Collective Content, your publishing or booking of any Listing via the TravCP Platform, participation in any Experience or Event or use of any other Host Service, participation in the Group Payment Service, or any other interaction you have with other Members whether in person or online remains with you. Neither TravCP nor any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the TravCP Platform or Collective Content will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress arising out of or in connection with (i) these Terms, (ii) from the use of or inability to use the TravCP Platform or Collective Content, (iii) from any communications, interactions or meetings with other Members or other persons with whom you communicate, interact or meet with as a result of your use of the TravCP Platform, or (iv) from your publishing or booking of a Listing, including the provision or use of a Listing’s Host Services, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and whether or not TravCP has been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose. Except for our obligations to pay amounts to applicable Hosts pursuant to these Terms or an approved payment request under the TravCP Host Guarantee, in no event will TravCP’s aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with these Terms and your use of the TravCP Platform including, but not limited to, from your publishing or booking of any Listings via the TravCP Platform, or from the use of or inability to use the TravCP Platform or Collective Content and in connection with any Restaurant, Experiences, Event, other Host Service, the Group Payment Service, or interactions with any other Members, exceed the amounts you have paid or owe for bookings via the TravCP Platform as a Tourist in the twelve (12) month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or if you are a Host, the amounts paid by TravCP to you in the twelve (12) month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or one hundred U.S. dollars (US$100), if no such payments have been made, as applicable. The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between TravCP and you. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you. If you reside outside of the Nigeria, this does not affect TravCP’s liability for death or personal injury arising from its negligence, nor for fraudulent misrepresentation, misrepresentation as to a fundamental matter or any other liability which cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.</h5>

<h2 class="title">17. Indemnification</h2>
<h5 class="description">To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to release, defend (at TravCP’s option), indemnify, and hold TravCP and its affiliates and subsidiaries, including but not limited to, TravCP Payments, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your breach of these Terms or our Policies or Standards, (ii) your improper use of the TravCP Platform or any TravCP Services, (iii) your interaction with any Member, visit to any Restaurant, participation in an Experience, Event or other Host Service, participation in the Group Payment Service, including without limitation any injuries, losses or damages (whether compensatory, direct, incidental, consequential or otherwise) of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of such interaction, stay, participation or use, (iv) your breach of any laws, regulations or third party rights.</h5>

<h2 class="title">18. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement</h2>
<h5 class="description">18.1 This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement shall apply if your (i) country of residence or establishment is in Nigeria; or (ii) your country of residence or establishment is not in Nigeria, but bring any claim against TravCP in Nigeria (to the extent not in conflict with Section 20).</h5>
<h5 class="description">18.2 Overview of Dispute Resolution Process. TravCP is committed to participating in a consumer-friendly dispute resolution process. To that end, these Terms provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom Section 18.1 applies: (1) an informal negotiation directly with TravCP’s customer service team, and (2) a binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) using its specially designed Consumer Arbitration Rules (as modified by this Section 18 and except as provided in Section 18.6). Specifically, the Consumer Arbitration Rules provide:</h5>
Claims can be filed with AAA online (www.adr.org);
Arbitrators must be neutral and no party may unilaterally select an arbitrator;
Arbitrators must disclose any bias, interest in the result of the arbitration, or relationship with any party;
Parties retain the right to seek relief in small claims court for certain claims, at their option;
The initial filing fee for the consumer is capped at $200;
The consumer gets to elect the hearing location and can elect to participate live, by phone, video conference, or, for claims under $25,000, by the submission of documents;</h5>
The arbitrator can grant any remedy that the parties could have received in court to resolve the party’s individual claim.</h5>
<h5 class="description">18.3 Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification. Prior to initiating an arbitration, you and TravCP each agree to notify the other party of the dispute and attempt to negotiate an informal resolution to it first. We will contact you at the email address you have provided to us; you can contact TravCP’s customer service team by emailing us. If after a good faith effort to negotiate one of us feels the dispute has not and cannot be resolved informally, the party intending to pursue arbitration agrees to notify the other party via email prior to initiating the arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a claim must be filed with the AAA and the written Demand for Arbitration (available at www.adr.org) provided to the other party, as specified in the AAA Rules.</h5>
<h5 class="description">18.4 Agreement to Arbitrate. You and TravCP mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the applicability, breach, termination, validity, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or to the use of the TravCP Platform, the Host Services, the Group Payment Service, or the Collective Content (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding individual arbitration (the “Arbitration Agreement”). If there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced or applies to our Dispute, you and TravCP agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue.</h5>
<h5 class="description">18.5 Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement. You and TravCP each agree that the following claims are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction: (i) Any claim related to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) Any claim seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack).</h5>
<h5 class="description">18.6 Arbitration Rules and Governing Law. This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration will be administered by AAA in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules and/or other AAA arbitration rules determined to be applicable by the AAA (the “AAA Rules“) then in effect, except as modified here. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879.</h5>
<h5 class="description">18.7 Modification to AAA Rules - Arbitration Hearing/Location. In order to make the arbitration most convenient to you, TravCP agrees that any required arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option, (a) in the county where you reside; (b) in any other location to which you and TravCP both agree; (c) via phone or video conference; or (d) for any claim or counterclaim under $25,000, by solely the submission of documents to the arbitrator.</h5>
<h5 class="description">18.8 Modification of AAA Rules - Attorney’s Fees and Costs. You and TravCP agree that TravCP will be responsible for payment of the balance of any initial filing fee under the AAA Rules in excess of $200 for claims of $75,000 or less. You may be entitled to seek an award of attorney fees and expenses if you prevail in arbitration, to the extent provided under applicable law and the AAA rules. Unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous or filed for the purpose of harassment, TravCP agrees it will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law or the AAA Rules, to recover attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</h5>
<h5 class="description">18.9 Arbitrator’s Decision. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper jurisdiction. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.</h5>
<h5 class="description">18.10 Jury Trial Waiver. You and TravCP acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable Disputes.</h5>
<h5 class="description">18.11 No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings. You and TravCP acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney general action, or any other representative proceeding as to all Disputes. Further, unless you and TravCP both otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If the “class action lawsuit” waiver or the “class-wide arbitration” waiver in this Section 19.11 is held unenforceable with respect to any Dispute, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement will be deemed void with respect to such Dispute and the Dispute must proceed in court. If the “private attorney general action” waiver or the “representative proceeding” waiver in this Section 19.11 is held unenforceable with respect to any Dispute, those waivers may be severed from this Arbitration Agreement and you and TravCP agree that any private attorney general claims and representative claims in the Dispute will be severed and stayed, pending the resolution of any arbitrable claims in the Dispute in individual arbitration.</h5>
<h5 class="description">18.12 Severability. Except as provided in Section 19.11, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and effect.
<h5 class="description">18.13 Changes. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3 (“Modification of these Terms”), if TravCP changes this Section 19 (“Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement”) after the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email) within thirty (30) days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of TravCP’s email to you notifying you of such change. Rejecting a new change, however, does not revoke or alter your prior consent to any earlier agreements to arbitrate any Dispute between you and TravCP (or your prior consent to any subsequent changes thereto), which will remain in effect and enforceable as to any Dispute between you and TravCP.</h5>
<h5 class="description">18.14 Survival. Except as provided in Section 19.12 and subject to Section 15.8, this Section 19 will survive any termination of these Terms and will continue to apply even if you stop using the TravCP Platform or terminate your TravCP Account.</h5>
<h2 class="title">19. Feedback</h2>
We welcome and encourage you to provide feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the TravCP Platform (“Feedback“). You may submit Feedback by emailing us, through the “Contact” section of the TravCP Platform, or by other means of communication. Any Feedback you submit to us will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary to you. By submitting Feedback to us, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-licensable, perpetual license to use and publish those ideas and materials for any purpose, without compensation to you.</h5>
<h2 class="title">20. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
<h5 class="description">20.1 If your country of residence or establishment is Nigeria, these Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws the Nigerian law, without regard to conflict-of-law provisions. Judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions) that are excluded from the Arbitration Agreement in Section 19 must be brought in state or federal court in San Francisco, California, unless we both agree to some other location. You and we both consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in San Francisco, California.</h5>
<h2 class="title">21. General Provisions</h2>

<h5 class="description">21.1 Except as they may be supplemented by additional terms and conditions, policies, guidelines or standards, these Terms constitute the entire Agreement between TravCP and you pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersede any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between TravCP and you in relation to the access to and use of the TravCP Platform.</h5>

<h5 class="description">21.4 If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be struck and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.</h5>
<h5 class="description">21.5 TravCP’s failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise permitted under law.</h5>
<h5 class="description">21.6 You may not assign, transfer or delegate this Agreement and your rights and obligations hereunder without TravCP's prior written consent.
